 make a mac app, ready for mac app store, called "Blue Screen of Death" subtitle "a modern bell of awareness: protect eyesight and attention". Menu bar app. It makes the blue screen of death every two hours. Menu bar has option to disable and to set custom logic for when to trigger. The full description says that it can be used to enable mindfulness, or as a reminder to focus eyes in the distance to avoid going near-sighted. The logo is a blue square with white 0x. In the menu bar the logo is 0x.
 Pressing any key exits the blue screen of death.
 No references to "Microsoft" or other patented or trademarked things, but do generate random hex offsets and believable blue screen of death dump every. You're allowed to include funny easter eggs in the hex codes.

 Should be thoroughly tested and reliable. Linted, code coverage, development is driven by makefile. Avoid needing permissions. If we can't cover whole screen and have to still show the menu bar that is totally fine, if anything it's more funny.

Make isolated, reviewable commits with instructions on how to manually test.
 Throughout your process, use subagents heavily to conserve context and a team of subagents to help review (one is linus torvalds, two are official app store reviewers who may push back on the app but don't sacrifice humor). We really want to get this into the app store, so be clear to focus on the meditative and eye-protective qualities. Make it classic and nostalgic for former windows users. This is so cool!
